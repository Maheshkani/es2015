## ES6 Modules 
Modules are an integral part of your code, and it's what makes your app readable and maintainable in the long run. In fact, it is good practice to break up your code into modules where possible to make your code more readable and scalable in the future. Before the latest update to JavaScript there wasn't any native way of creating and using modules, all of the modules approaches that are currenty in use today such as CommonJS and AMD are not native to JavaScript. They are just ways in which we can emulate a module system using either CommonJS or AMD library. 

With this in mind, the committee responsible for defining the ECMAScript specification decided that it was time to add native support for modules in JavaScript. The JavaScript community has really embraced the approaches of CommonJS and AMD, and these approaches have been implemented by NodeJS and RequireJS respectively. So, with this in mind, the committee decided that they wanted to create a native module system that would appease user of both camps.
