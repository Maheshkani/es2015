## ES6 Modules 
Modules are integral part of your code, and it's what makes your app readable and maintainable in the long run. In fact, it is good practice to break up your code into modules where possible to make your code more readable and scalable in the future. Before the latest update to JavaScript there wasn't any native way of creating and using modules, all of the modules approaches that are currenty in use today such as CommonJS and AMD are not native to JavaScript. They are just ways in which we can emulate a module system using either CommonJS or AMD. 

With this in mind, the committee responsible for definging the ECMAScript specification decided that it was time to add native support for modules in JavaScript.
