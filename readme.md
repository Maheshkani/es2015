#ES2015 JavaScript reloaded

JavaScript has undergone some major changes in the latest update to the language, which was finalized in June 2015. You might have heard it by the name ES6 but this is the old name. The committee decided to change from version number to year of release to better reflect their plans to release a new version every year which is great news for JavaScript developers. In case you're not familiar, JavaScript is also called ECMAScript, and the current version which is supported by all browsers is ECMAScript 5.1, which was finalized in 2011.
